## About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Aleks, a passionate hobbyist programmer with a primary focus on C++. I also have a working knowledge of C#, Python, and web development languages. I can craft simple websites, but my true passion is C++.

I'm currently in my second year of Computer Science studies, exploring algorithms, data structures, and advanced programming concepts. What I learn in class helps me better understand the theoretical aspects of programming, and I eagerly apply that knowledge to my hands-on coding projects.

Currently, I work as a photographer using AI to retouch photos and generate images.
