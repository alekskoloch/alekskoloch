## About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Aleks, a passionate hobbyist programmer with a primary focus on C++. While I also have a working knowledge of C#, Python, and web development languages. I can craft simple websites, but my true passion is delving into the intricacies of C++.

I'm currently in my second year of computer science studies, exploring algorithms, data structures, and advanced programming concepts. What I learn in class helps me better understand the theoretical aspects of programming, and I eagerly apply that knowledge to my hands-on coding projects.

Presently, I work as a photographer, endeavoring to incorporate my expertise in coding, particularly harnessing the latest AI advancements for photo editing and graphic generation.
